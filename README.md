### Description:

Predict whether or not a horse can survive based upon past medical conditions.

Noted by the "outcome" variable in the data.

Content:

All of the binary representation have been converted into the words they actually represent. However, a fuller description is provided by the data dictionary (datadict.txt).

There are a lot of NA's in the data. This is the real struggle here. Try to find a way around it through imputation or other means.

Attribute Information:

1: surgery? 
1 = Yes, it had surgery 
2 = It was treated without surgery 

2: Age 
1 = Adult horse 
2 = Young (< 6 months) 

3: Hospital Number 
- numeric id 
- the case number assigned to the horse (may not be unique if the horse is treated > 1 time) 

4: rectal temperature 
- linear 
- in degrees celsius. 
- An elevated temp may occur due to infection. 
- temperature may be reduced when the animal is in late shock 
- normal temp is 37.8 
- this parameter will usually change as the problem progresses, eg. may start out normal, then become elevated because of the lesion, passing back through the normal range as the horse goes into shock 
5: pulse 
- linear 
- the heart rate in beats per minute 
- is a reflection of the heart condition: 30 -40 is normal for adults 
- rare to have a lower than normal rate although athletic horses may have a rate of 20-25 
- animals with painful lesions or suffering from circulatory shock may have an elevated heart rate 

6: respiratory rate 
- linear 
- normal rate is 8 to 10 
- usefulness is doubtful due to the great fluctuations 

7: temperature of extremities 
- a subjective indication of peripheral circulation 
- possible values: 
1 = Normal 
2 = Warm 
3 = Cool 
4 = Cold 
- cool to cold extremities indicate possible shock 
- hot extremities should correlate with an elevated rectal temp. 

8: peripheral pulse 
- subjective 
- possible values are: 
1 = normal 
2 = increased 
3 = reduced 
4 = absent 
- normal or increased p.p. are indicative of adequate circulation while reduced or absent indicate poor perfusion 

9: mucous membranes 
- a subjective measurement of colour 
- possible values are: 
1 = normal pink 
2 = bright pink 
3 = pale pink 
4 = pale cyanotic 
5 = bright red / injected 
6 = dark cyanotic 
- 1 and 2 probably indicate a normal or slightly increased circulation 
- 3 may occur in early shock 
- 4 and 6 are indicative of serious circulatory compromise 
- 5 is more indicative of a septicemia 

10: capillary refill time 
- a clinical judgement. The longer the refill, the poorer the circulation 
- possible values 
1 = < 3 seconds 
2 = >= 3 seconds 

11: pain - a subjective judgement of the horse's pain level 
- possible values: 
1 = alert, no pain 
2 = depressed 
3 = intermittent mild pain 
4 = intermittent severe pain 
5 = continuous severe pain 
- should NOT be treated as a ordered or discrete variable! 
- In general, the more painful, the more likely it is to require surgery 
- prior treatment of pain may mask the pain level to some extent 

12: peristalsis 
- an indication of the activity in the horse's gut. As the gut becomes more distended or the horse becomes more toxic, the activity decreases 
- possible values: 
1 = hypermotile 
2 = normal 
3 = hypomotile 
4 = absent 

13: abdominal distension 
- An IMPORTANT parameter. 
- possible values 
1 = none 
2 = slight 
3 = moderate 
4 = severe 
- an animal with abdominal distension is likely to be painful and have reduced gut motility. 
- a horse with severe abdominal distension is likely to require surgery just tio relieve the pressure 

14: nasogastric tube 
- this refers to any gas coming out of the tube 
- possible values: 
1 = none 
2 = slight 
3 = significant 
- a large gas cap in the stomach is likely to give the horse discomfort 

15: nasogastric reflux 
- possible values 
1 = none 
2 = > 1 liter 
3 = < 1 liter 
- the greater amount of reflux, the more likelihood that there is some serious obstruction to the fluid passage from the rest of the intestine 

16: nasogastric reflux PH 
- linear 
- scale is from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral 
- normal values are in the 3 to 4 range 

17: rectal examination - feces 
- possible values 
1 = normal 
2 = increased 
3 = decreased 
4 = absent 
- absent feces probably indicates an obstruction 

18: abdomen 
- possible values 
1 = normal 
2 = other 
3 = firm feces in the large intestine 
4 = distended small intestine 
5 = distended large intestine 
- 3 is probably an obstruction caused by a mechanical impaction and is normally treated medically 
- 4 and 5 indicate a surgical lesion 

19: packed cell volume 
- linear 
- the # of red cells by volume in the blood 
- normal range is 30 to 50. The level rises as the circulation becomes compromised or as the animal becomes dehydrated. 

20: total protein 
- linear 
- normal values lie in the 6-7.5 (gms/dL) range 
- the higher the value the greater the dehydration 

21: abdominocentesis appearance 
- a needle is put in the horse's abdomen and fluid is obtained from 
the abdominal cavity 
- possible values: 
1 = clear 
2 = cloudy 
3 = serosanguinous 
- normal fluid is clear while cloudy or serosanguinous indicates a compromised gut 

22: abdomcentesis total protein 
- linear 
- the higher the level of protein the more likely it is to have a compromised gut. Values are in gms/dL 

23: outcome 
- what eventually happened to the horse? 
- possible values: 
1 = lived 
2 = died 
3 = was euthanized 

24: surgical lesion? 
- retrospectively, was the problem (lesion) surgical? 
- all cases are either operated upon or autopsied so that this value and the lesion type are always known 
- possible values: 
1 = Yes 
2 = No 

25, 26, 27: type of lesion 
- first number is site of lesion 
1 = gastric 
2 = sm intestine 
3 = lg colon 
4 = lg colon and cecum 
5 = cecum 
6 = transverse colon 
7 = retum/descending colon 
8 = uterus 
9 = bladder 
11 = all intestinal sites 
00 = none 
- second number is type 
1 = simple 
2 = strangulation 
3 = inflammation 
4 = other 
- third number is subtype 
1 = mechanical 
2 = paralytic 
0 = n/a 
- fourth number is specific code 
1 = obturation 
2 = intrinsic 
3 = extrinsic 
4 = adynamic 
5 = volvulus/torsion 
6 = intussuption 
7 = thromboembolic 
8 = hernia 
9 = lipoma/slenic incarceration 
10 = displacement 
0 = n/a 
28: cp_data 
- is pathology data present for this case? 
1 = Yes 
2 = No 
- this variable is of no significance since pathology data is not included or collected for these cases

### Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:
- The Dataset was quiet small totalling around 300 samples & after preprocessing 3.9% of the datasamples were dropped. 
- The samples were slightly imbalanced after processing, hence SMOTE Technique was applied on the data to  balance the classes, adding 30.4% more samples to the dataset.
- Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the relationship between the feature-set.
- Feature Selection/Eliminination was carried out and appropriate features were shortlisted.
- Testing multiple algorithms with fine-tuning hyperparamters gave us some understanding on the model performance for various algorithms on this specific dataset.
- The XG-Boosting & Random Forest Classifier performed exceptionally well on the current dataset, considering F1-Score as the key-metric.
- Yet it wise to also consider simpler model like Logistic Regression as it is more generalisable & is computationally less expensive, but comes at the cost of slight misclassifications.
